# no-login
> Script to use instagram, facebook and twitter functionally without logging in and fix website layouts, as Wikipedia

You can install the project at this moment, but beware that this project is in it's earliest stages and many things are not done, or are not even added.

Currently the extentions is only tested using Chrome, but it will be extended to more browsers as the project furthers in development.

## Installation Instructions 
1. Download this repo as a [ZIP file from GitHub](https://github.com/LegeBeker/no-login/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
1. Unzip the file and you should have a folder named `no-login-main`.
1. In Chrome/Edge go to the extensions page (`chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`).
1. Enable Developer Mode.
1. Drag the `no-login-main` folder anywhere on the page to import it (do not delete the folder afterwards).

## List of things that need to be added:
- ~~Wikipedia removal off whitespace 2022 redesign~~
- Preferences (ability to turn off some parts of the extention)
- Twitter functionality
- Instagram functionality
- Facebook functionality
- Youtube playlist sort

Any suggestions are welcome!
